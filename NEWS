	* Various #include fixes.

Olena 0.2	November 28, 2001

	* Color:
	  - nrgb_8, nrgb_16, nrgb_32: new types for NTSC RGB.  The
            conversion from and to YIQ and HSI which assumed NTSC RGB
	    has been adjusted to actually use nrgb_* (instead of rgb_*)
	    and renamed accordingly.
	  - yuv_8, yuv_16, yuv_32: New types.

	  The currently available conversions are

                    hsi   yuv
                      \  /
	       rgb -- nrgb
                \     /  \
                  xyz     yiq

	* Various cleanups and bug fixes.  Especially:
	  - border handling (mirroring, copying) simplified and fixed.
	  - ++k, --k: return a value with the same type as k.

	* I/O:
	  - pnm/P1, pnm/P3, and pnm/P6 support for image_3d.

Olena 0.1f	November 22, 2001

	* Core:
	  - Several bug fixes in memory handling.

	* Types:
	  - New color types: HSI, YIQ; with conversions to and from RGB.
	  - `min()' and `max()' are now defined with the types (i.e.
	    not in math/macros.hh), along with the other operators.
	    Also, these procedures will two arguments of different
	    types.

	* Casts:
	  - `cast::round': similar to C's round()
	  - `cast::rbound': ditto, but constrained to fit the
            output type's range.

	* I/O:
	  - Support for `image_3d<int_u<N> >' (as PNM P2 & P5).

	* Processings
	  - `level::is_greater_or_equal', `level::is_greater',
	    `level::is_lower_or_equal', `level::is_lower',
	    `level::is_equal': Comparisons between images.
	  - `level::connected_component': Number connected components.
	  - `morpho::geodesic_dilation', `morpho::simple_geodesic_dilation'.
	  - `morpho::geodesic_erosion', `morpho::simple_geodesic_erosion'.
          - `morpho::get_plus_se_only', `morpho::get_plus_se_p',
	    `morpho::get_minus_se_only', `morpho::get_minus_se_p': Split
	    a structural element in a `plus' (lexicaly before than the center)
	    and `minus' (after).

	* Misc:
	  - `utils::timer': for benchmarking
	  - `level::lut', `level::hlut': Lookup tables.

Olena 0.1d	November 15, 2001

	* Core:
	  - `point's, `dpoint's, and `image_size's feature a `nth()' method,
	    that returns the value of the nth coordinate.
	  - `fold': new high order operator.

	* Types:
	  - `vec<N,T>' uses an array to store its elements
            and accepts builtin types.
	  - `rgb<T>' has been replaced by `rgb_8', `rgb_16', `rgb_32'
	  - `xyz_8', `xyz_16', `xyz_32' are new types.
	  - the latter six types are instances of the `color' type.

	* Processings:
	  - All basic morpholohical processings (`opening',
	    `hit_or_miss', `beucher_gradient', etc.) from namespace
	    `morpho::' have their fast equivalent in namespace
	    `morpho::fast::'.
	  - `convert::apply' is similar to `apply' but will work
	    for all types of conversions while `apply' can only work
	    on `conversion_to_type' conversions.

	* Tools:
	  - `utils::fill': fill an image
	  - `utils::f_moments', `utils::f_minmax': statistical functors.

	* Casts:
	  - `cast::bound': similar to `convert::bound'.

	* I/O:
	  - It's possible to load and save as PPM any kind of image2d
	    whose color has 3 components on 8 bits.

Olena 0.1b	November 8, 2001

	* New type: rgb<T>

	* New processings:
	  - morpho::watershed_con
	  - convol::fast::gaussian
	  - convol::fast::gaussian_derivative
	  - convol::fast::gaussian_second_derivative

	* Conversion are organized in the following hierarchy

	    conversion<Inferior>
                  ^
		  |
	    conversion_to_type<To,Inferior>
                  ^
		  |
	    conversion_from_type_to_type<From,To,Inferior>

	  All children of conversion_from_type_to_type are models of
	  Adaptable Unary Function.  See conversion.hh for more comments.

	* The only two functions that perform file i/o are `load' and
 	  `save'.  The other functions (`read', `write', `read_pnm',
	  `write_pnm') have been removed.

	* image2d<rgb<int_u8> > can be loaded and saved as ppm.

	* All iterators support a new method, cur(), that returns
	  the current point (or dpoint).  It is meant to be used
	  at places where the compiler is unable to implicitly convert
	  an iterator into a point (or dpoint).

	* Bug fixes:
	  - Olena now compiles successfully with -pedantic.
	  - `image2d<int_u8> lena = load("lena.pgm");' works.
	  - Multiplications and subtractions on 'vec' no longer
	    perform additions.

        * Initial public release.
