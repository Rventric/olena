=================
Developer's Guide
=================

This file gathers some useful information for Olena developers and
contributors.


-------------
Bootstrapping
-------------

If you are fetching Olena from its Git repository, you will need to
run `bootstrap' to build files that are not recorded in the
repository::

        ./bootstrap

By default, `bootstrap' does not regenerate files that are stored on
the repository.  If you want to refresh them (e.g., because your
working copy is in a bad state), you can ask bootstrap to regenerate
them::

        ./bootstrap --regen

On a configured tree, you can also use Make to perform the same task::

        make regen


-----------------
Required Software
-----------------

In addition to the required packages listed in README, you may need
the following extra programs if you want to work on the Olena project.

   * If you want to make changes anywhere within the project, you will
     need:

        - GNU Autoconf 2.61,

        - GNU Automake 1.10,

        - GNU Libtool 1.5.22.

   * If you plan to make changes within Swilena, you must have:

        - SWIG 1.3.35,

        - Python 2.5.

   * If you want to change and/or rebuild the documentation, the
     following tools are required:

        - Doxygen 1.5.6,

        - a fairly recent LaTeX distribution,

        - the `listings' LaTeX package,

        - the `convert' utility from ImageMagick (6.3.7),

        - HeVeA 1.10

        - LaTeX2HTML (or at minimum, its `html.sty' style file),

        - bibtex2html 1.95 or higher (at least the bibtex2html and
          bib2bib tools).


Note that `bootstrap' checks for the presence of most of these tools.


----------------------
Useful Developer Tools
----------------------

   * `rebox.el' is a useful companion to Emacs, creating boxes with
     comment delimiters.


---------
Releasing
---------

Things to remember before releasing a new version of Olena, roughly in
this order:

   * Olena is designed to be released as a whole package
     (`olena-x.y.tar.{gz,bz2}') *and* as seperate components
     (`milena-x.y.tar.{gz,bz2}', `olena-scribo-x.y.tar.{gz,bz2}',
     `swilena-x.y.tar.{gz,bz2}', etc.).  Both procedures should be
     checked.

   * Update and sync `NEWS' and `README' files in the top-level and
     subprojects directories (milena/, scribo/, etc.).

   * Likewise, update all `AUTHORS' files.  Hint: use
     `git shortlog -s DIR' to get the list of all authors who have
     contributed to the files under directory DIR.

   * Update revision numbers in `configure.ac' in the top-level and
     subprojects directories (`milena/', `scribo/', etc.).

   * Create all packages using `make distcheck' (not just
     `make dist').

   * Install the packages in `/lrde/dload/olena/x.y/', along with the
     Olena's `NEWS' and `README' files, and Milena's documentation (in
     `/lrde/dload/olena/x.y./doc/') and ensure they are accessible
     from the Web.

   * Create a new page on the Olena Web site for the new release (e.g,
     http://olena.lrde.epita.fr/OlenaXYZ for release x.y.z), update
     the Download page (http://olena.lrde.epita.fr/Download) and make
     an announcement on the main page (http://olena.lrde.epita.fr/).
     Also update the link under the Download item of the left bar
     (http://olena.lrde.epita.fr/WebContents).

   * Likewise, announce the release on the Olena Trac
     (https://trac.lrde.org/olena/).

   * Make an announce on the LRDE Web site as well
     (http://www.lrde.epita.fr/cgi-bin/twiki/view/Lrde/News).

   * Finally, post an announce to annonce@lrde.epita.fr.  See the files
     `ANNOUNCE-x.y' at the root of the repository for models.

   * Tag the commit COMMIT corresponding to the release in the
     repository, and push it to the Git server.

        git tag -m "Olena release x.y." olena-x.y COMMIT
        git push tag olena-x.y

   * After the release, do not forget to append an `a' to the release
     number in `configure.ac's (e.g., turn `1.1' into `1.1a') to
     prevent any mistake regarding version numbers in subsequent
     releases.  Create new (empty) sections in `NEWS' files
     accordingly.
