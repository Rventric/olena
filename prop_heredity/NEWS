prop_heredity 1		July 9, 2004

	* Initial public release.

	* Theo made a new hierarchy based on property heredity.
	  - Easier to understand.
	  - Easier to extend (i.e. for morphers).

	* Theo changed the any_with_diamond model which is very time
          consuming. The idea is to have the choice :
	  - memory policy: it's the same than the actual implementation
	  in Olena.
	  - speed policy: in this way, you keep for each class an attribute
	  setting the base class address. So you lose an attribute but you
	  win 30% of execution time.
