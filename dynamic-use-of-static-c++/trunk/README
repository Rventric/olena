HOW TO USE THIS PROJECT

From the repository:

  # Initialize the build system
  ./bootstrap

  # Make a build dir
  mkdir _build && cd _build

  # Configure the build for your system
  # The config.site try to use more efficient tools (g++-4.0 and ccache)
  # it also enable the configure caching.
  # With --prefix you can set the destination (here _install)
  CONFIG_SITE=`pwd`/../config.site ../configure --prefix=`pwd`/../_install

  # For now need to add the bin directory to your path because dyn-config is
  # by programs compiled with our system
  export PATH=$PATH:`pwd`/bin

  make check # The test with a latest prototype of olena will fail if you
             # don't checkout it:
             # cd test/olena && svn co https://svn.lrde.epita.fr/svn/oln/prototypes/proto-stl-style
