# FIXME: The type of the (Python) object returned by this call,
# <type 'SwigPyObject'>, is wrong.  The right type should be 
# <class 'image2d_point2d.image2d_point2d'>, but the fact that the
# routine and the result object are located in two different
# (generated) Swilena submodules seems to confuse SWIG.  A consequence
# of this issue is that `max_tree_parent' is not usable at all, hence
# the failure of the last line of this test.  We should perhaps review
# Swilena's design and minimize or even completely get rid of the
# modular approach...
max_tree_parent = image.max_tree(ima, c4());

# FIXME: Overloading issue: Why can't we use
#
#   image2d_point2d.println("max_tree_parent =", max_tree_parent)
#
# ?
## 2013-04-09: Disabled, until a solution is found.
