you will need qt3 library (and headers) to compile this graphical interface.

to create the Makefile just type:
qmake

You will need to edit the Makefile to insert the include paths for Olena:
INCPATH  = .... -I/path/to/olena/metalic -I/path/to/olena/integre \
           -I/path/to/olena/olena

Please also delete "-W" and "-Wall" from the following lines :
CFLAGS   = ...
CXXFLAGS = ...

You can add -DNDEBUG to these lines.
