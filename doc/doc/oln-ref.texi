@chapter Introduction

This reference manual will eventually document any public class and
functions available in Olena.  Sadly, it only covers the morphological
processing presently.

The @file{demo/} directory contains a few sample programs that may be
worth looking at before digging the source or sending us an email
(@email{olena@@lrde.epita.fr}).
