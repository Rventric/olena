Never include config.h.  It's not installed (because it contains too
many values that could clash with other user definitions).

Use pconf.hh if needed.  This one is installed.  It's generated by
grep'ing out of config.h the lines required by the headers listed in
$(PCONF_OCCURS) in src/Makefile.am.
