    \headerfile <>

    \brief A box defined on the 3D square grid with integer
    coordinates.

    This class is a site set of mln::point3d. It represents a rectangle of
    mln::point3d which is usually used as domain for a mln::image3d.

    mln::box3d is a typedef of box<mln::point3d>.

    Iteration over the mln::point3d of a mln::box3d relies on p-iterators
    and it can be performed using the following code:

    \code
    box3d b(3,3,3);
    mln_piter(box3d) p(b);
    for_all(p)
      std::cout << p << std::endl;
    \endcode

    Common sites can be retrieved through pmin(), pmax() and pcenter().
