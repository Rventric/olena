    \class mln::box2d
    \headerfile <>

    \brief A box defined on the 2D square grid with integer
    coordinates.

    This class is a site set of mln::point2d. It represents a rectangle of
    mln::point2d which is usually used as domain for a mln::image2d.

    mln::box2d is a typedef of box<mln::point2d>.

    Iteration over the mln::point2d of a mln::box2d relies on p-iterators
    and it can be performed using the following code:

    \code
    box2d b(3,3);
    mln_piter(box2d) p(b);
    for_all(p)
      std::cout << p << std::endl;
    \endcode

    Common sites can be retrieved through pmin(), pmax() and pcenter().
    \verbatim
    pmin
      X------------.---------->
      |   pcenter  |
      |      X     |
      |            |
      .------------X
      |           pmax
      |
