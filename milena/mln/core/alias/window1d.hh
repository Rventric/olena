    \class window1d
    \headerfile <>

    \brief Type alias for a window with arbitrary shape, defined on
    the 1D square grid with integer coordinates.

    Common 1D windows are predefined and can be used directly. See
    section \ref modwin1d.

    The list of dpoint1d included in a window1d is accessible from
    std_vector() method or simply by iterating over this list:

    \code
    window1d win;
    for (int i = 0; i < win.size(); ++i)
      std::cout << win.dp(i) << std::endl;
    \endcode

    Iterating over the neighbors of a specific point is performed
    thanks to q-iterators, as follows:

    \code
    point1d p(2);
    window1d win;
    mln_qiter(window1d) q(win, p);
    for_all(q)
      // q is a point1d, neighbor of p.
      std::cout << q << std::endl;
    \endcode

    It also works while iterating the sites of an image domain:

    \code
    image1d<bool> ima(4);
    window1d win;
    mln_piter(image1d<bool>) p(ima.domain());
    mln_qiter(window1d) q(win, p);
    for_all(p)
      for_all(q)
        // q is a point1d, neighbor of the current p.
        std::cout << q << std::endl;
    \endcode
