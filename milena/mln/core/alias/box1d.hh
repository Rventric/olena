    \brief A box defined on the 1D square grid with integer
    coordinates.

    This class is a site set of mln::point1d. It represents a rectangle of
    mln::point1d which is usually used as domain for a mln::image1d.

    mln::box1d is a typedef of box<mln::point1d>.

    Iteration over the mln::point1d of a mln::box1d relies on p-iterators
    and it can be performed using the following code:

    \code
    box1d b(3);
    mln_piter(box1d) p(b);
    for_all(p)
      std::cout << p << std::endl;
    \endcode

    Common sites can be retrieved through pmin(), pmax() and pcenter().
    \verbatim
        pmin    pcenter    pmax
    -----X--------X---------X-------->
    \endverbatim
