xml_to_html

Produce HTML view from ICDAR (or LRDE extended) XML.

*Compilation:

 Just change the paths to olena and milena in xml_to_html.pro

*Usage:

 -m, --merge: Merge an XML with an other XML
        args: <xml_file_1> <xml_file_2> [xml_output]

Useful to merge LRDE XML extended mode files with ICDAR XML files to combine both images and recognized text.


 -c, --create-html: Crop images (if exist) from the ppm file using the XML file and produce an html output.
     args: <xml_file> [ppm_file] [output dir]

If no PPM file is given, the program will only produce an HTML output without images.
If a PPM file is given, the program will crop image_region, separator_region, graphic_regions, chart_region and table_region to output_dir/img/id.png

*Result:

To view the result run your internet browser on output_dir/output.xml (Does not work with Chrome on local, use a LAMPP server to fix this ;-) ).
