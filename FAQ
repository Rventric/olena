Q: My source tree behaves strangely.

R: Make sure you have many development tools installed, and then run:

     make maintainer-clean
     ./bootstrap.sh

    (from the toplevel source directory)

    This will clear anything that can be regenerated back, and
    re-generate the project control files (autoreconf)

---

Q: I do not want to involve the  documentation in my build process (it
   takes too long and/or I do not have the tools to  build it). How can I
   disable it ?

R: run the toplevel configure with the following flags:

    --without-doc

   or, if you do not want to build the manuals but still compile the
   demonstraction programs :

    --without-manuals

---

Q: the toplevel configure script does not show all options when passed
   --help. What is happening ?

R: Some options (most of the feature-related ones, in fact) only
   pertain to the doc/ and src/ subdirectories. Run:
 
      configure --help=recursive

   to see them all.

Q: I know that automake-generated Makefiles can re-run configure and
   re-generate themselves when I change Makefile.am. How can I activate
   this feature ?

R: run configure with the following flags:
  
    --enable-maintainer-mode --enable-dependency-tracking

Q: How can I use Olena in my projects ?

Option 1: add -Ipath_to_installed_headers to your compile flags.
     This is simple, however works poorly as soon as you do not use
     the exactly same compiler configuration as used to install
     Olena. For a more general approach, use options 2 or 3.

Option 2: Use autoconf and the provided oln.m4. Several macros can be
     used:

     - OLN_PATH_HEADERS

         Require configure to look for Olena, and set OLN_INCLUDE_DIR
         accordingly.
	 This macro can be passed a directory as a "hint".

     - OLN_PATH_IMGS

         Require configure to look for sample images bundled with the
         Olena distribution, and set OLN_IMG_DIR accordingly.
	 This macro can be passed a directory as a "hint".

     - AC_WITH_OLN

	 Implies OLN_PATH_HEADERS and OLN_PATH_IMGS.
	 Checks compiler  features and add necessary AC_DEFINEs (stuff
	 in your config.h) and flags to OLN_CXXFLAGS and OLN_CPPFLAGS.

     - OLN_ENABLE_EXCEPTIONS

	 Enable the raise of C++ exceptions instead of aborting on
	 errors. This breaks some optimizations, so do not use unless
	 required. Updates OLN_CPPFLAGS.

     See the file oln/tests/configure.ac for an example invocation of
     these macros.

Options 3 (not yet available): Use olenize.

     After you run "olenize" in a directory, two files appear there:
 
         - oln-config.h
         - oln-config.sh

     Then, add calls to oln-config.sh to retrieve compile flags:

         c++ -c `./oln-config.sh --cxxflags` file.cc -o file.o

     To compile with exceptions enabled, use -DOLN_EXCEPTIONS.
