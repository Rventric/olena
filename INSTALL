Installing
==========

   To install the Olena headers, command-lines utilities and additional
files on your system, run:

      $ make install

   from the build directory.

   If not overriden with `--prefix' (see the BUILD file) , this will
install:

   * the headers in `/usr/local/include/oln',

   * the utilities in `/usr/local/bin',

   * sample images in `/usr/local/share/oln',

   * the Autoconf helper `oln.m4' in `/usr/local/share/aclocal'.



   You can later remove Olena from your system by running

      $ make uninstall

   from the build directory.
