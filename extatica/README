HOW TO USE THIS PROJECT

  Note: These instructions have been updated since this project has
  been re-integrated into the Olena repository (October 2009).
  However, they will probably evolve again, since the project should
  eventually become a part of the Olena distribution.  The biggest
  change will probably be to run things from the parent directory
  (Olena's) and enable a configure flag to activate this module.

From the repository:

  # Initialize the build system.
  ./bootstrap

  # Make a build dir.
  mkdir _build && cd _build

  # Configure the build for your system.
  ../configure

  # You can also use the file `config.site' shipped with the
  # distribution, though it is a bit old.  `config.site' tries to use
  # more efficient tools (g++-4.0 and ccache).  It also enables
  # configure's caching mechanism.  With `--prefix' you can set the
  # destination (here, `../_install').
  CONFIG_SITE=`pwd`/../config.site ../configure --prefix=`pwd`/../_install

  # You may want to add the `bin/' directory to your path, but it is
  # no longer mandatory (`dyn-config' from `bin/' used to be required
  # by programs compiled with our system).
  export PATH=$PATH:`pwd`/bin
