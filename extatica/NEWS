* Extatica 0.1a		MONTH DAY, YEAR

	* First public release.

	* Revival of the `dynamic-use-of-static-c++' prototype,
	  modernization of the infrastructure, and renaming as
	  ``Extatica''.

	* Better handling of extra dependencies of the package: many
	  Ruby parts have been turned into C++ code; dependencies (MD5,
	  Libiberty's C++ mangler/demangler) have been integrated into
	  the project.

	* First experiments with Milena: addition of a few wrappers
	  around Milena routines; first ``dynamic'' Python wrappers
	  over Milena using SWIG and Extatica.
