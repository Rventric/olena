This is the third public release of Olena, a generic image processing
library in C++.

This release accompanies the following article

  Generic Implementation of Morphological Image Operators,
  Jérôme Darbon, Thierry Géraud, and Alexandre Duret-Lutz,
  submitted to International Symposium On Mathematical Morphology VI
  (ISMM 2002), April 3-5, 2002, Sydney, Australia.


Olena is a project developed by the EPITA Research and Development
Laboratory (www.lrde.epita.fr) since 1997.  We did numerous prototypes
and throw-away experiments before settling into the kind of
programming paradigm which is finally here.

This version of Olena is quite young.  In fact most of the operators
have been translated from the sources of Milena, an image processing
library which works only on 2D images (Milena stands for "mini-Olena")
and which is not publicly available.

Therefore this code is still experimental and not very polished.
The file named ISSUE, in the root directory of the distribution,
contains a list of known issues about Olena.

We haven't written a real documentation yet.  In the doc/ directory
you will find the start of a reference manual which presently
documents only the morphological operators.  In the demo/ directory
lie a few sample programs.  The file demo/tour.cc attempts to
introduce you to the basics of Olena.  For the rest, we're afraid you
will have to dig the code or e-mail us.

Please direct any question or comments to <olena@lrde.epita.fr>,
or <olena-bugs@lrde.epita.fr>.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

This code has been tested with GCC 2.95.3 and GCC 3.0.2.

To compile the two programs in the demo/ directory, run

  ./configure
  make

If you want to install the headers files (the library IS the set
of headers, there is no binary) on your system, do

  make install

this will install the files in /usr/local/include/oln.
You can tune the '/usr/local/include' part of the path
by passing an --includedir option to configure. For
instance

  ./configure --includedir=/foo/bar
  make install

will install the files in /foo/bar/oln.


It is also easy to build the demo/ files manually, just include
the src/ directory in the include search path of the compiler.

  cd demo
  g++ -I../src -Wall -O2 tour.cc

With GCC 2.95.x, it's likely you will need to allow the compiler
to instantiate templates to a greater depth than the default (17),
using an option like -ftemplate-depth-50.
